# MamaAway

In collaboration with Gorka Pi√±ol (@heyslide), Toni Arellano (@pezmosca) and Cristian Ferrer (@yonimevicio) 

MamaAway is an Android app that lets its users organise their lives and coordinate easily with the people they live with; its target is students who left their homes for college, but it's not the only group which may find it useful. MamaAway is divided in two main sections:

- The Home section offers the functionalities focused on the household as a whole: a shopping list shared between all the flatmates, a task organiser to plan everyone's share of the house work (cleaning, taking the trash out, etc), a calendar to schedule events that require staying home (such as parties or special dinners) and the Naughty Night alarm, that lets all your flatmates know that it'd be better if they left the house alone that night for you and your partner ;)
- The Personal section offers the functionalities focused on the user of the app: a personal shopping list and a list of tutorials (such as ironing or washing clothes) and cooking recipes.
